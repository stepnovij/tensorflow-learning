# Evaluation tensorflow on MNIST dataset

Simple educational repo to evaluate tensorflow library.

## Currently implemented

* logistic regression with constant training batch
* logistic regression with dynamic training batches
* nn with one relu
* spurious local minimum [goodfellow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6544) with two hidden relus 
* simple convolutional nn (best score on test data: 97.3%) 

Implementing parts of official [tensowflow's examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py)
